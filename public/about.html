<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Cameron MacKinnon, I'm currently trying to learn HTML, CSS and Java Script</p>

<p>Currently I only have a little HTML and CSS experience. I'm currently taking Angela Yu's course and this is all that i've made through
  the course so far!</p>

<p>I'm hoping to eventually get a job in programming/web development but I'm currently early in the journey
  so this portfoilio will show my progress overtime.</p>
