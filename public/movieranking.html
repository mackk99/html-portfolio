<h1>Cameron MacKinnon's Favourite Shows</h1>
<h2>My top 3 favourite shows of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Lost</h3>
<p>My favourite show of all time is lost, it has mystery,
   interesting plot twists and things you would never expect.</p>
<h3>Prison break</h3>
<p>Prison break has a lot of unique characters
    some you will hate, some you will love, but the show is very
    unique and something you wont find elsewhere.
</p>
<h3>Daredevil</h3>
<p>Daredevil is a Marvel show with a superhero with unique abilities
    he is a regular human who was blind as a child due to an accident
    however this made his other senses heightened, he's able to hear
    people's heartbeats to know if they're lying, hear people through
    walls or down the street, it's a good watch.</p>
